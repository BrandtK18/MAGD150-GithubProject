# MAGD150-GithubProject

This Repository holds 3 of the Lab assignments that I've done over the course of MAGD 150.  
Each lab is coded using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), and each project includes a index file that opens a webpage of the project.

#### LAB 7
For this lab, it was focused on grouping draw methods together using **push()** and **pop()**. I wanted to use this to create cat and dog drawings, and then loop them falling out of the sky.


#### LAB 8
_This project requires a simple web server of somekind to run_

For this assignment we learned how to load and use images in our sketches. We were required to format our file folders to have an asset folder, and the put the assets within that folder so we could load it into the sketch.  
I decided to make a really simple sketch where you can move the sprites around on the screen by moving your mouse, and then clicking would spawn a bullet.

#### LAB 10
_This project requires a simple web server of somekind to run_

For this assignment we were required to use a p5 library, and use the functions that it adds in our code. I went with the [p5 SceneManager](https://github.com/mveteanu/p5.SceneManager), which allowed me to make a point and click puzzle game with different views.
